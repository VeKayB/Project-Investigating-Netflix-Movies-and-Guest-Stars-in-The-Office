# Project-Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
This project is the first given by the DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python track. On the inside, we have to implement what we have learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to complete this project task. Such tools as Pandas (including DataFrame Creation, DataFrame Subsetting, DataFrame Column Selection, and DataFrame Iteration), Matplotlib (including line plots and scatter plots), file reading (CSV), dictionaries, and lists are utilized in this project.

# ðŸ“º Project Description
In this project, Iâ€™ll apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I will use everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib to figure out if Netflix movies are growing shorter over time. 

# Project Tasks

   1. Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
   2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
   3. A visual inspection of our data
   4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
   5. Filtering for movies!
   6. Creating a scatter plot
   7. Digging deeper
   8. Marking non-feature films
   9. Plotting with color!
   10. What next?
